# Webshop-clownartists

A webshop made with vanilla javascript for the made-up company Clown Artists.
In this project, I wanted to work with local storage (using javascript) and practise shop cart possibilites.
A future version will have a product page (using node.js)
Also added a simple javascript/canvas feature where the visitor can upload a picture and make their own meme (and then save it)!

The webshop design was made during a course in light UX at Nackademin, see the pitch here: https://indd.adobe.com/view/58a4cc43-661c-48b3-916e-c1dd7104b404

In the website version, some adaptions were made (for example, using more UX-friendly buttons than in the design project)

This project is focused on creating a webshop using javascript:
In this project I have learned about local storage, and explored the class functions https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes (as well as async with its await), and how to dynamically work with JSON.
